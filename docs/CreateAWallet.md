When you're setting up a wallet, be sure to:
✅ Download and install only the latest version from an official source.
✅ Follow the setup guide carefully.
✅ Safely back up your recovery phrases.
❌ NEVER share your recovery phrases with anyone, under any circumstances.
❌ NEVER input your recovery phrase to a website or app, other than your wallet app.

Getting private key from mobile to import to desktop
Token Pocket lets you use both a desktop and mobile wallet. This section will cover how to get your private key from your mobile wallet to import into your desktop wallet.
Please be extremely careful with how you handle your private keys. Giving your private keys to someone will give them full access to your coins! Token Pocket is an open source project and will use your private key to import your wallet. Even so, only use your private key with applications you trust and can verify are legitimate!
1. Tap the Me tab on the bottom ribbon and tap Manage Wallets.

2. On the next page, tap the Binance Smart Chain entry. Be careful not to tap the address part, or you’ll only copy that to clipboard instead.

3. When the menu appears, find and tap the Export Private Key option. Type in your password to get your private key.
NEVER, in any situation, should you ever give someone your private key or recovery phrase ("seed phrase"). This will give someone complete access to your crypto!

The genuine PancakeSwap site and staff will never ask you to input your seed phrase.
Now you have your private key ready to import your wallet into the desktop version of Token Pocket.
